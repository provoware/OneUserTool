# OneUserTool

This project contains a collection of small PyQt5 utilities. The modules are
organized in the repository root.

## Running the application

Make sure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the tool using:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Running the tests

The repository uses `pytest` for tests. After installing the dependencies you
can run the test suite from the project root:

```bash
pytest
```

This executes the tests in the `tests/` directory.
